# SpaceX_Tutorial

This is an application for displaying rocket launches. It is created by followign a tutorial as I seek to expand my knowledge of React and begin learning GraphQL.

##Setup Instructions
Open the main project folder in the terminal and use 'npm i' to install all needed dependencies. Do the same in the client folder. The app should be ready to run.

##Start Scripts
To start both the server and the client open the project folder in the terminal and execute 'npm run dev' this will start both the client and server.

This project was initially bootstrapped with Create React App.
